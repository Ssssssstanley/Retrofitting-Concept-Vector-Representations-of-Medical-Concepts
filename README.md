Estimation of semantic similarity and relatedness between biomedical concepts has utility for many informatics applications. Automated methods fall into two categories: methods based on distributional statistics drawn from text corpora, and methods using the structure of existing knowledge resources. Methods in the former disregard taxonomic structure, while those in the latter fail to consider semantically relevant empirical information. In this work, we present a method that retrofits distributional context vector representations of biomedical concepts using structural information from the UMLS Metathesaurus, such that the similarity between vector representations of linked concepts is augmented. 

We evaluated this approach on the UMNSRS benchmark. Our results demonstrate that retrofitting of concept vector representations leads to better correlation with human raters for both similarity and relatedness, surpassing the best results reported to date. We also demonstrated a clear improvement on the correlation with standards from retrofitted vector representation compared to the vector representation without retrofitting.
